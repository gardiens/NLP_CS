      "**Overall Sentiment Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall sentiment appears to be **mostly positive**, leaning slightly towards positive. However, there are a few instances of negative feedback that need attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Detailed Breakdown:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Positive Sentiment:**\n",
      "    *   “I LOVE THIS PLACE” - Very positive.\n",
      "    *   “I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED!” - A strong positive endorsement.\n",
      "    *   “The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare, the dishes are never a disappointment.” –  Positive and enthusiastic.\n",
      "    *   “I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz. of Maine Lobster in it.” - Positive.\n",
      "    *   “The martinis are amazing and very fairly priced.” - Positive.\n",
      "    *   “The food is excellent!” - Very positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Negative Sentiment:**\n",
      "    *   “I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED!” -  While positive, the context indicates a slightly frustrating experience.\n",
      "    *   “I can EAT HERE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK REALLY LOL LOVE THIS PLACE…” –  This is a very enthusiastic statement with a slightly unusual emphasis. It's positive, but the tone is exaggerated.\n",
      "    *   “though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their food.” - Negative.\n",
      "    *   “The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.” - Negative.\n",

      "    *   “The fish was really,really fresh.” - Neutral, as it's a descriptive statement.\n",
      "    *   “The food is excellent!” - Positive, but fairly generic.\n",
